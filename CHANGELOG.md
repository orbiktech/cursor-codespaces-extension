## [0.4.0] - 2025-11-XX

### Added
- **Custom SSH Config File Support**: Extension now detects and uses custom SSH config file location from VS Code settings (`remote.SSH.configFile`), ensuring compatibility with users who have configured a non-default SSH config path
- **Remote Containers Extension Incompatibility Detection**: Added automatic detection and handling for incompatible VSCode Remote Containers extension, with one-click fix to switch to Anysphere Remote Containers extension
- **Marketplace Keywords**: Added comprehensive keywords to improve extension discoverability in marketplace searches

### Fixed
- **Custom SSH Config File Location**: Fixed issue where extension would write to default SSH config location (`~/.ssh/config`) even when users had configured a custom SSH config file path, causing connection failures
- **Remote Containers Conflict**: Fixed connection failures caused by incompatible VSCode Remote Containers extension when used with Anysphere Remote SSH extension

### Improved
- **SSH Config Path Detection**: Improved SSH config file path resolution to properly handle custom paths, including `~` expansion and relative path resolution
- **Extension Compatibility Checks**: Enhanced dependency checking to detect and resolve extension incompatibilities before connection attempts
- **User Experience**: Better error messages and UI guidance when extension incompatibilities are detected, matching the same helpful pattern as other dependency checks

## [0.3.1] - 2025-11-XX

### Added
- **Remote-SSH Explorer Integration**: Added tree item in explorer that shows when Remote-SSH extension is missing, with one-click installation
- **Automatic Remote-SSH Detection**: Explorer automatically polls and refreshes when Remote-SSH extension is installed
- **Linux SSH Key Generation**: Automatic SSH key generation on Linux systems when keys are missing

### Fixed
- **Remote-SSH Extension ID**: Fixed detection to use correct Cursor extension ID (`anysphere.remote-ssh`) instead of VS Code's extension ID
- **Missing SSH Keys on Linux**: Fixed connection failures on Linux when SSH keys weren't automatically generated by GitHub CLI
- **Silent Remote-SSH Failures**: Fixed issue where Remote-SSH availability check would fail silently, now properly shows installation prompt in explorer

### Improved
- **Remote-SSH Setup Flow**: Improved user experience for Remote-SSH installation, matching the same pattern as GitHub CLI setup
- **Early Dependency Checks**: Remote-SSH availability is now checked early in the connection flow, preventing silent failures

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-XX

### Added
- **Installation Instructions in Sidebar**: When GitHub CLI is not installed, the sidebar now shows helpful installation instructions with a direct link to download
- **Authentication Error Handling**: The sidebar now displays clear messages when GitHub CLI authentication is required or when additional scopes are needed
- **Automatic Refresh Polling**: The explorer automatically refreshes every 3 seconds when authentication/scope errors are detected, eliminating the need for manual refresh
- **One-Click Authentication**: Clicking authentication/scope error messages opens a terminal with the required command pre-filled
- **Remote-SSH Installation Prompt**: When Remote-SSH extension is missing, users are prompted to install it with a direct link to the marketplace
- **Linux Platform Support**: Improved compatibility with Linux systems including proper SSH config permissions handling and shell execution

### Improved
- **Error Detection**: Enhanced error detection for authentication and scope issues, including better pattern matching for GitHub CLI error messages
- **User Experience**: Clearer error messages and tooltips throughout the extension
- **Explorer Refresh**: Explorer now refreshes automatically when the sidebar becomes visible
- **Initial Load**: Fixed issue where explorer wouldn't show content on first activation without restart

### Fixed
- **Empty Sidebar on Fresh Install**: Fixed issue where sidebar showed nothing when GitHub CLI was installed but not authenticated
- **Manual Refresh Required**: Fixed issue where users had to manually refresh after completing authentication - now auto-refreshes
- **Linux SSH Permissions**: Fixed SSH config file and directory permissions handling on Linux systems
- **Shell Execution**: Improved shell command execution for better PATH resolution on Linux
