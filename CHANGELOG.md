### Fixed
- **Search Race Conditions**: Fixed race conditions in repository and branch search where old results could overwrite newer ones

### Improved
- **Repository Search**: Searches across all your repositories using GitHub API, not just the first 50
- **Branch Search**: Uses pagination to fetch and search across all branches in a repository
- **Codespace Creation Flow**: Streamlined UX - creation returns immediately and connection handles waiting
